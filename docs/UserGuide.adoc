e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 s/Mathematics d/Monday, 12:00pm` : adds a student named `John Doe` to the TutorHelper.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

====
*Valid Inputs*

1. Subjects

Valid subjects are limited to only the following subjects: +

`Mathematics`, `Biology`, `Chemistry`, `Physics`, `Economics`, `Geography`, `History`

* In order to be valid subjects, the input must be a full substring match of length 3 or more with any of the valid subjects. This is to avoid too short of keyword matching.
* The match must start at the beginning of the subject name. This is to avoid confusion and multiple matching.
* Matching is case insensitive.

Examples:

* `Biology`, `Bio`, or `bio` will match with `Biology`.
* `iology` will not match will `Biology` as the match does not start from the beginning.
* `Ma` will not match `Mathematics` because the length of subtring is shorter than three.
* `phy` will only match `Physics` and will not match `Geography` as matching is done from the beginning of the string.
* `Maths` will not match `Mathematics` as it is not a full substring match.
