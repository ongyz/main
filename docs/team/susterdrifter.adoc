== PROJECT: TutorHelper
By CS2103 W13-4

== Overview

TutorHelper is a desktop administration application intended for Tutors who would like to organise
their students' information. TutorHelper uses CLI(command-line interface) as its main form of
inputs: where tutors issues commands in the form of successive line of text. Having multiple
students at once can be a hassle to deal with, especially with each student having his own
curriculum, tuition timing, and payments. Our team of five decided to create TutorHelper by
building upon the existing AddressBook Level 4 application. TutorHelper offers an easy way to
keep track of the tutor schedule and keep tabs on the students, allowing him to efficiently plan
ahead. Some of the new main features include : grouping, payment, earnings, add/edit/delete/mark
syllabus, and add/delete/copy subject.

This project portfolio consists of the contributions I have made to TutorHelper.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability *to manipulate state of syllabus within subjects as well as copy a subject from one student to another*.

** What it does: User can add, remove, or mark syllabus from the specified subject. User can also copy a whole subject,
along its contents, to another student.
** Justification: Tutors need to differentiate between subjects of different levels or schools.
Allowing manipulation of syllabus provides greater amount of flexibility and details of each subject.
However, in the case where multiple students who actually studies the same content, `copysub` command
allow users to easily manage the subjects.
** Highlights: Copying can lead to duplicated syllabus and subjects which needs to be addressed.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Add syllabus into TutorHelper (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/7[#7])
** Allow students to have multiple subjects  (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/35[#35])
** Converts subjects to enumeration for easier management of code (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/65[#65])
** Data writing into storage of subject and its syllabus (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/46[#46])
** Re-implementation of BrowserPanel into its current fxml implementation (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/226[#226])
