== PROJECT: TutorHelper

== Overview

TutorHelper is a desktop administration application intended for Tutors who would like to organise their students' information. TutorHelper uses CLI(command-line interface) as its main form of inputs: where tutors issues commands in the form of successive line of text. Having multiple students at once can be a hassle to deal with, especially with each student having his own curriculum, tuition timing, and payments. Our team of five decided to create TutorHelper by building upon the existing AddressBook Level 4 application. TutorHelper offers an easy way to keep track of the tutor schedule and keep tabs on the students, allowing him to efficiently plan ahead.

Some of the new main features include : +
Grouping +
Payment +
Earnings +
Add/Edit/Delete/Mark Syllabus +
Add/Delete/Copy Subject

This project portfolio consists of the contributions I have made to TutorHelper.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to group the students based on their tuition timing and sort accordingly to day or time*.

** What it does: allows the user to either group students by the day of the tuition or the timing. Grouping by day will sort the students in that day by their tuition timing and grouping by time will sort the students with that tuition timing by the days of the week.
** Justification: Tutors are busy and want to know how many classes they have to teach in a specific day or how often in a week they have to teach at a specific timing.
** Highlights: Grouping the students will permanently sort the list of students. This can be undone with the `undo` command.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Add Subject and TuitionTiming into TutorHelper (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/11[#11])
