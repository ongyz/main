== Project: TutorHelper

== Overview

TutorHelper is a desktop administration application intended for Tutors who would like to organise their students' information. TutorHelper uses CLI(command-line interface) as its main form of inputs: where tutors issues commands in the form of successive line of text. Having multiple students at once can be a hassle to deal with, especially with each student having his own curriculum, tuition timing, and payments. Our team of five decided to create TutorHelper by building upon the existing AddressBook Level 4 application. TutorHelper offers an easy way to keep track of the tutor schedule and keep tabs on the students, allowing him to efficiently plan ahead.

Some of the new main features include: +
Grouping +
Payment +
Earnings +
Add/Edit/Delete/Mark Syllabus +
Add/Delete/Copy subject

This project portfolio consists of the contributions I have made to TutorHelper.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Contributed Code*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=lywjoel[RepoSense]

* *Major Enhancement*:
** Added *the ability to add and delete subjects taken to student entries* (Pull Request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/112[#112])
*** This enhancement allows the tutor to add and delete subjects taken by their students. Each subject will have its own list of syllabus topics.
*** Justification: Students of tutors may request to receive tuition for more than one subject from the same tutor. This enhancement allows the tutor to record such instances instead of creating a new student entry for each subject.
*** Highlights: A student entry must have at least one subject taken at all times. Logically, a student entry should not exist if the student is not taking a subject taught by the tutor.

* *Minor Enhancements*:
** [Deprecated] Added and updated a simple HTML display to facilitate display of student information (Pull Requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/25[#25], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/31[#31], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/78[#78], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/93[#93])
